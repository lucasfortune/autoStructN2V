class BaseNoiseDataset(Dataset):
    """
    Base dataset class that implements common functionality for all Noise2Void datasets.
    
    This class serves as a foundation for different types of Noise2Void datasets (training,
    validation, and testing). It handles basic operations like image loading, tensor
    conversion, and dataset length calculation. The class is designed to be flexible,
    supporting both patch-based processing (for training/validation) and full-image
    processing (for testing).

    Args:
        image_paths (list): List of paths to input images.
        patch_size (int, optional): Size of image patches to extract. Required for 
            training and validation datasets, but not for test datasets.
        patches_per_image (int, optional): Number of patches to extract per image.
            Required for training and validation datasets, but not for test datasets.

    Methods:
        __len__: Returns dataset length (either number of total patches or number of images)
        load_image: Helper method to load and normalize an image
        __getitem__: Must be implemented by child classes
